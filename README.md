## 🚀 About Me

I’m a results-driven Computer Science student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, with strong foundations in **data analysis, algorithms, and system design**.

I enjoy working across the **entire data pipeline** — from data cleaning and visualization to building, training, and deploying machine learning models. I balance **theory + practice**, with 600+ LeetCode problems solved and hands-on experience in **Python, PyTorch, Flask, and full-stack development**.

I believe good tech should be:
- ✅ Data-driven  
- ✅ Scalable  
- ✅ Actually useful in the real world
